# deep-learning-challenge

## Notes
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Outputs
First Attempt (Starter_Code.ipynb):  \
    1. Preprocessing:  \
        a. Drop the EIN and NAME columns \
        b. Target variable: IS_SUCCESSFUL \
    2. Compiling, Training and Evaluating:  \
        a. Hidden Layer 1: 80 neurons \
        b. Hidden Layer 2: 30  neurons \
        c. Epochs: 100 \
    3. Accuracy: 72.93 \

Optimization Attempt 1 (AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization1.ipynb):  \
    1. Preprocessing: Same as initial model \
    2. Compiling, Training and Evaluating:   \
        a. Hidden Layer 1: 100 neurons \
        b. Hidden Layer 2: 50 neurons \
        c. Epochs: 120 \
    3. Accuracy: 73.01

Optimization Attempt 2 (AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization2.ipynb):  \
    1. Preprocessing: Same as initial model \
    2. Compiling, Training and Evaluating:   \
        a. Hidden Layer 1: 100 neurons \
        b. Hidden Layer 2: 50 neurons \
        c. Epochs: 150 \
    3. Accuracy: 73.11 

Optimization Attempt 3 (AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization3.ipynb):  \
    1. Preprocessing: Same as initial model \
    2. Compiling, Training and Evaluating:   \
        a. Hidden Layer 1: 100 neurons \
        b. Hidden Layer 2: 45 neurons \
        c. Epochs: 170 \
    3. Accuracy: 72.91 

## Summary 
We did not accomplish the 75% accuracy target after multiple optimization attempts. The highest accuracy this model attained was 73.11% at the second optimization. We ran through different iterations for the hidden layers of neurons and epochs. Further enhancements could be made by continuing to iteratate through different compiling/training/evaluating steps.
